## Description
### Our Good to Go app is a simple and easy to use curbside pickup application. After creating this app we are able to add many local restaurants and customers can generate orders online.  This will streamline the process for both customer and business.  With the customer creating the order mistakes should be reduced.  This is a full stack application and has been deployed on heroku.  We use a npm library called passport to authenticate new user accounts.  Our application will also notify the customer when the order has been delivered and when it is ready for pickup.
